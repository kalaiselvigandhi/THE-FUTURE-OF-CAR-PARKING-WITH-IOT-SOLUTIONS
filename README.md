# THE-FUTURE-OF-CAR-PARKING-WITH-IOT-SOLUTIONS

ABSTRACT:
The current lifestyle of the peoples in the universe is totally changed from the start of human civilization. Nowadays the density of living peoples in urban area gradually increasing year by year. For this reason we
are facing more like lack of natural resources, pollution, traffic etc. Here we are noted the main problem towards parking in metro areas like Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai,
Delhi. When the people plan to travel somewhere within the cities first they are think about where to park our application. In todayâ€™s world most of the problems are vanished by technology. So that we are trying to solve the parking problem in metro cities using mobile application.
Here we are using combined Internet of Things and Mobile Application to solve the parking problem. Initially location of the parking station in metro cities show to the user using
Geographical Positioning System (GPS). When user picks the particular parking station the availability of the car parking places in that station will be show to the user. These are all
done by using Internet of Things (IOT) like the availability of the places in particular parking station will uploaded to the server automatically so that the user can get the updated
availability of the parking place. Finally when the user picks the particular parking place using pre-payment it will automatically booked to the user while automatically
updated in the server. In the conclusion the difficulty to find out the parking station and availability of places at that particular station minimized using Technology. In future we
are trying to implement this approach to all major cities in our nation. In the system we are using the location the car address in the particular location can be stored in the
database in the system it can be used in the system and this system can be used in the particular location in the system they can be used in the location and the system can be used
in the particular location and it can be used in the system.

CONCLUSION:
The smart parking system based on IoT concept has been implemented using various sensor circuitry and cloud (server). It is an efficient system for car parking which prevails traffic congestion. This work is further extended
as smart car parking system with automatic billing system also fully automated system using multilayer parking method. Safety measures such as vehicle no, tracing, driver face recognition. Also care has taken so that
there is no malfunction of wrong vehicle entering into the allocated slot by providing an unique OTP to each person and ensuring the same person parks in the given slot.
